## Executive Summary

Medius sits at an inflection point. The AP automation market is being disrupted from two directions: legacy players like SAP Concur and Coupa are adding AI features to protect installed bases, while AI-native entrants like Ramp and Brex are attacking from below with product-led growth and embedded finance. Meanwhile, regulatory tailwinds (e-invoicing mandates) and technology shifts (agentic AI) create unprecedented opportunity for a well-positioned player to capture category leadership.

My strategic thesis: Medius should reposition as ***the Autonomous Finance Platform***—the only solution that combines 20 years of AP domain expertise with AI-native architecture to deliver truly autonomous finance operations. This isn't incremental improvement to existing automation; it's a fundamental reimagining of how the Office of the CFO operates.

The strategic bets I propose are designed to create compounding advantages that will be extremely difficult for competitors to replicate, while generating near-term revenue to fund the transformation.

## Question 1: Market Repositioning

> *If you had to reposition Medius in the market to win against both legacy AP automation players and AI-native entrants, what would your narrative and strategic anchor be?*

### The Strategic Narrative

**Core Positioning:** "Medius is the Autonomous Finance Platform—where 20 years of AP expertise meets AI-native architecture to deliver finance operations that run themselves."

This positioning creates clear differentiation on two axes:

### Against Legacy Players (SAP Concur, Coupa, Tipalti)

- **They automate; we autonomize.** Legacy players bolt AI onto existing architectures designed for human-in-the-loop processing. Medius is building AI-native from the ground up—agents that execute, not just assist.
- **They reduce clicks; we eliminate work.** Moving from 94.9% touchless to 99%+ isn't incremental—it's transformational for how finance teams operate.
- **They serve the process; we serve the CFO.** Legacy tools optimize individual workflows. Medius optimizes outcomes—cash flow, working capital, compliance, risk.

### Against AI-Native Entrants (Ramp, Brex, Stampli)

- **They have AI; we have AI plus 20 years of domain data.** $200B in annual spend data across 4,000+ customers creates training data and benchmarks that startups cannot replicate.
- **They serve SMB; we serve the enterprise.** Complex multi-entity, multi-currency, multi-ERP environments require deep domain expertise that takes years to build.
- **They capture cards; we capture the full spend lifecycle.** From sourcing to payment, Medius is the system of record for everything a CFO needs to control.

### The Strategic Anchor: "CFO Command Center"

The anchor concept is the CFO Command Center—a unified cockpit where finance leaders see real-time spend visibility, predictive cash flow, compliance status, and AI-surfaced opportunities. This reframes Medius from a back-office processing tool to a strategic command platform.

**The narrative arc:**

1. **Yesterday:** AP was a cost center—headcount-heavy, error-prone, reactive
2. **Today:** AP automation reduces friction but still requires oversight
3. **Tomorrow:** Autonomous finance—AI agents handle execution while CFOs focus on strategy
4. **Medius:** The only platform with the domain depth AND AI sophistication to make tomorrow real today

## Question 2: Strategic Bets

> *What 2–3 bold strategic bets would you propose to bring this vision to life?*

I propose three interconnected bets, sequenced to generate early wins that fund longer-term transformation:

### Bet #1: Own the E-Invoicing Compliance Layer

**Timing: Immediate (regulatory deadline-driven)** 🔴

**The Opportunity:** E-invoicing mandates are accelerating globally—Belgium (Jan 2026), Poland (Feb 2026), France (Sept 2026), Germany (Jan 2027). Every multinational operating in Europe MUST comply or face rejected invoices, tax penalties, and VAT deduction denial. This is not optional.

**The Bet:** Build proprietary compliance intelligence rather than remaining dependent on Pagero (now uncertain following Thomson Reuters acquisition). Become a certified Peppol Access Point. Create the industry's most comprehensive regulatory tracking and format transformation engine.

**Why This Wins:**

- **Urgency creates budget:** Compliance deadlines unlock spending that would otherwise be deferred
- **Stickiness at its finest:** Once Medius is your compliance engine, switching costs are enormous
- **Reduces partner dependency:** Pagero uncertainty is a risk; owned capability is an asset
- **Land-and-expand vector:** Win compliance → cross-sell full AP automation

**Investment:** $5-8M over 12 months. Revenue potential: $15-25M ARR within 24 months.

### Bet #2: Launch Payment Monetization Engine

**Timing: Near-term (revenue-generating)** 🟢

**The Opportunity:** Medius customers currently capture only ~40% of available early payment discounts. Virtual card adoption is ~15% of eligible spend. Dynamic discounting and supply chain finance programs are nascent. There's $375K-$1.15M in annual value per $100M in payables that customers aren't capturing.

**The Bet:** Build an integrated payment optimization layer that maximizes customer value while generating transaction-based revenue for Medius. This includes:
1. Dynamic discounting with sliding-scale offers
2. Supply chain finance integration with major platforms
3. Virtual card expansion with intelligent supplier enablement
4. AI-optimized payment timing based on cash position

**Why This Wins:**

- **Changes the ROI conversation:** From cost reduction to profit generation
- **Creates recurring transaction revenue:** Diversifies beyond subscription fees
- **Deepens customer value:** Customers who monetize payments have highest NRR
- **Competes with Ramp/Brex economics:** Matches their value proposition while serving enterprise

**Investment:** $5-8M over 12-18 months. Revenue potential: $10-20M in transaction revenue within 24 months, plus significant customer acquisition advantage.

### Bet #3: Deploy Agentic AI Architecture

**Timing: Medium-term (differentiation)** 🟣

**The Opportunity:** The competitive landscape is rapidly moving toward AI agents. Tipalti announced agentic capabilities. Stampli has Billy the Bot. BILL launched AgenTeq. The market perception is that AI-native entrants have the advantage. Medius must demonstrate that domain expertise + AI is more powerful than AI alone.

**The Bet:** Build a constellation of specialized AI agents—Capture Agent, Classification Agent, Matching Agent, Risk Agent, Communication Agent, Payment Agent—that collaborate to execute finance operations autonomously. Move from AI-assisted to AI-autonomous.

**Why This Wins:**

- **Transforms the touchless metric:** 94.9% → 99%+ fundamentally changes how finance teams operate
- **Creates narrative ownership:** "The Autonomous Finance Platform" becomes Medius's territory
- **Leverages the data moat:** $200B in spend data trains agents that outperform generic AI
- **Defensible over time:** Agent performance improves with customer volume—network effect

**Investment:** $15-20M over 18-24 months. This is the largest bet but creates the most durable differentiation.

## Question 3: Long-Term Strategic Pillars

> *Beyond the initial strategic bets, what longer-term strategic pillars would you establish to ensure Medius builds a durable competitive advantage over the next 3–5 years?*

### Pillar 1: Data Network Effects

Every customer makes the platform smarter. Every invoice processed, every correction made, every fraud detected improves models for all customers. This creates increasing returns to scale that new entrants cannot replicate.

**Key investments:**
- Federated learning infrastructure that improves models without exposing customer data
- Benchmarking database that becomes industry standard for AP metrics
- Supplier payment behavior intelligence that no single customer could build alone

### Pillar 2: Supplier Network Lock-In

The supplier portal is Medius's Trojan horse. Every buyer customer creates hundreds of supplier touchpoints. Convert suppliers into the network → suppliers prefer buyers who use Medius → flywheel accelerates.

**Key investments:**
- World-class supplier portal experience that suppliers actively prefer
- Supplier-to-buyer conversion motion (PLG through the network)
- Payment preference features that give suppliers reasons to encourage Medius adoption

### Pillar 3: Treasury Adjacency

AP is the largest source of predictable cash outflows. Extending into cash visibility, forecasting, and working capital optimization elevates Medius from operational tool to CFO strategic platform—without competing head-to-head with TMS vendors like Kyriba.

**Key investments:**
- Bank connectivity via open banking APIs (Plaid, MX, Yodlee)
- AI-powered cash forecasting using AP data as foundation
- Working capital dashboard for CFO visibility

### Pillar 4: Composable Platform Architecture

Enterprise buyers increasingly demand best-of-breed components that integrate into their ecosystem. Medius must be both a complete platform AND a set of composable services that work with existing investments.

**Key investments:**
- API-first architecture with published, versioned, developer-friendly APIs
- Marketplace for partner integrations (Ironclad, Avalara, etc.)
- Embedded deployment options for enterprise customers who want Medius inside their existing portals

### Pillar 5: Vertical Intelligence

Generic automation hits diminishing returns. Industry-specific models—understanding healthcare CPT codes, construction lien waivers, retail supplier chargebacks—create depth that horizontal players cannot match.

**Key investments:**
- Vertical-specific training data and models
- Industry compliance templates and workflows
- Reference customers in target verticals for social proof

## Question 4: Process for Vision Development

> *What process would you use to ensure the vision is differentiated, customer-backed, and commercially aligned?*

### Phase 1: Discovery & Diagnosis (Weeks 1-4)

#### Customer Intelligence
- **Win/Loss Analysis:** Deep dive on last 50 competitive deals—what resonated? What didn't?
- **Churn Interviews:** Why did customers leave? What would have kept them?
- **Champion Councils:** Establish executive advisory board with 10-15 strategic customers
- **Jobs-to-be-Done Research:** What are CFOs actually trying to accomplish? What's the emotional/social dimension?

#### Market Intelligence
- **Competitive Product Teardowns:** Hands-on analysis of Tipalti, Stampli, Ramp, BILL
- **Analyst Briefings:** Gartner, IDC, Forrester—where is the market heading?
- **Technology Scanning:** What's emerging in AI/ML that could disrupt current approaches?

#### Internal Intelligence
- **Product-Market Fit Analysis:** Where are we beloved? Where are we tolerated?
- **Technical Debt Audit:** What architectural constraints limit our ambition?
- **Capability Mapping:** What can we credibly build? What requires acquisition/partnership?

### Phase 2: Strategy Formation (Weeks 5-8)

- **Strategy Workshop:** Bring together exec team + key ICs for 2-day offsite. Use Mike Maples' 'Pattern Breakers' framework to identify where we can be non-consensus and right.
- **Strategic Options Development:** Generate 3-5 distinct strategic paths with honest tradeoffs
- **Financial Modeling:** Build bottoms-up revenue and investment models for each path
- **Risk Assessment:** What could kill each option? How would we know early?

### Phase 3: Validation & Refinement (Weeks 9-12)

- **Customer Concept Testing:** Present vision to 20+ customers—measure reaction, not just feedback
- **Pricing Validation:** Van Westendorp or Gabor-Granger studies on new value propositions
- **Board Alignment:** Structured board sessions to build conviction before public commitment
- **Go-to-Market Feasibility:** Can Sales actually sell this? What enablement is needed?

---

## Question 5: Validation Approach

> *How would you validate that this direction is right - both internally (with the board and teams) and externally (with customers, market, and data)?*

### Internal Validation

#### Board Alignment Framework
- **Strategic Premises Document:** Clearly state the assumptions underlying the strategy. "We believe X because Y. We will know we're wrong if Z."
- **Investment Thesis:** Frame each bet with expected return, timeline, and kill criteria
- **Quarterly Business Reviews:** Track leading indicators that validate or challenge strategy
- **Red Team Exercise:** Assign someone to argue the opposite case—steel-man the competition

#### Team Alignment Framework
- **Vision Document:** Written artifact that any employee can reference—clear, compelling, memorable
- **All-Hands Cascade:** Present strategy with Q&A; follow up with team-level sessions
- **OKR Alignment:** Every team's objectives should ladder to strategic pillars
- **Pulse Surveys:** Regular check on whether teams understand and believe in direction

### External Validation

#### Customer Validation
- **Design Partners:** Recruit 5-10 customers to co-develop major capabilities with early access
- **Painted Door Tests:** Measure interest in capabilities before building them (feature announcements → measure inquiry volume)
- **Win Rate Tracking:** Does new positioning improve competitive win rates?
- **NPS by Segment:** Are target customers (not all customers) more satisfied?

#### Market Validation
- **Analyst Validation:** Briefings with Gartner/Forrester—do they see the same market shifts?
- **Competitive Response:** Track competitor announcements—are they following our lead?
- **Inbound Demand:** Does thought leadership on new themes generate pipeline?
- **Talent Attraction:** Are A-players excited to join? Vision should be a recruiting asset

#### Data Validation
- **Leading Indicators:** Define 3-5 metrics that will show early signal of success
- **Cohort Analysis:** Track new vs. existing customer behavior with new capabilities
- **Usage Analytics:** Feature adoption rates; time-to-value; engagement depth

---

## Question 6: Cross-Functional Engagement

> *What methods would you use to ensure cross-functional engagement, particularly from Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, and Engineering, in shaping and owning the vision?*

### Core Principle: Co-Creation, Not Cascade

Strategy that's handed down gets compliance; strategy that's co-created gets commitment. Every function should see their fingerprints on the vision.

### Sales Engagement

- **Win/Loss Ride-Alongs:** Product leadership joins competitive deals to hear objections firsthand
- **Competitive Battle Cards:** Co-develop positioning with Sales—they know what actually wins
- **Roadmap Previews:** Early access to upcoming features for strategic deals
- **Sales Advisory Council:** Monthly forum with top sellers to pressure-test direction
- **Incentive Alignment:** SPIFs for selling strategic products to validate market fit

### Marketing Engagement

- **Messaging Co-Development:** Product and Marketing jointly own positioning—not handoff
- **Launch Partnership:** Marketing embedded in product process from concept through GTM
- **Demand Gen Alignment:** Understand what content generates pipeline; build product that delivers those outcomes
- **Analyst Relations:** Joint briefings to ensure story is credible and differentiated

### Customer Success Engagement

- **QBR Intelligence:** Systematic capture of customer feedback from business reviews
- **At-Risk Account Reviews:** Understand what's causing churn risk; feed into product priorities
- **Expansion Playbooks:** What upsells are working? What's the natural product expansion path?
- **Customer Advisory Board:** CS owns the relationship; Product gets the insight

### Engineering Engagement

- **Technical Strategy Ownership:** Engineering leads architecture decisions; Product leads what, Eng leads how
- **Innovation Time:** Dedicated capacity for engineer-led exploration aligned to strategic themes
- **Feasibility Reviews:** Early engineering input before commitments are made
- **Technical Debt Partnership:** Balanced allocation between features and platform health
- **Demo Days:** Engineers present work directly to leadership—visibility and recognition

### Governance Structure

| Forum | Participants | Cadence | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Product Council | CPO + VPs of Sales, Marketing, CS, Eng | Weekly | Tactical alignment |
| Strategy Review | Exec team + Board observers | Monthly | Strategic health check |
| Customer Advisory | 10-15 strategic customers | Quarterly | Outside-in validation |
| Planning Offsite | Extended leadership team | Bi-annual | Strategic refresh |

## Question 7: Vision Gaps & Uncertainties

> *If anything, what do you think is missing in the vision today, and which aspects are you the most uncertain about?*

### What's Missing in the Current Vision

#### 1. The "How We Win" is Underdeveloped

The vision articulates a compelling "what" (autonomous spend management) and "why" (CFO transformation), but the competitive differentiation—the "how we win against specific competitors"—needs sharpening. What is the wedge that creates initial traction? What prevents Tipalti, BILL, or SAP from copying our moves?

**Recommendation:** Develop explicit competitive positioning for each major competitor segment. Identify the 2-3 proof points that make our claims credible.

#### 2. The SMB Strategy is Absent

The vision focuses on enterprise CFO transformation, but AI-native entrants (Ramp, Brex, Mercury) are winning SMB and moving upmarket. If Medius cedes SMB, we lose the supplier network effects and talent pipeline that come from high-volume customer acquisition.

**Recommendation:** Add a Product-Led Growth pillar. Define a free or low-cost tier that captures SMB while generating supplier network value and enterprise leads.

#### 3. The Partner Strategy is Implicit

For a platform vision to succeed, ecosystem matters. The current vision doesn't address: Which partners extend our value? Where do we integrate vs. build? How do we become essential to the tech stack rather than replaceable?

**Recommendation:** Develop explicit partner strategy: ERP integration depth, contract management partnerships (Ironclad), tax compliance (Avalara), and potentially banking/fintech partnerships for payment monetization.

#### 4. The AI Safety & Trust Narrative is Missing

As AI becomes autonomous, customers will worry about errors, liability, and control. The vision should proactively address: How do we ensure AI decisions are explainable? What's the human override model? How do we handle mistakes? This is table stakes for enterprise adoption of autonomous systems.

**Recommendation:** Add "Trustworthy AI" as a principle. Develop the explainability, audit, and override framework that gives CFOs confidence to let AI execute.

### Areas of Greatest Uncertainty

#### 1. Pace of AI Capability Advancement

The AI landscape is moving faster than any technology shift I've seen. What's differentiating today (custom models, domain data) may be commoditized by foundation models in 18-24 months. Our strategy assumes domain expertise + AI creates durable advantage, but this may compress faster than expected.

**Mitigation:** Build strategic optionality. Ensure architecture can adopt new foundation models quickly. Focus on data and workflow moats that persist regardless of underlying AI technology.

#### 2. Payment Monetization Economics

The payment monetization bet assumes we can achieve meaningful scale in virtual cards, dynamic discounting, and SCF. But these require supplier adoption, buyer cash availability, and competitive rebate economics. The unit economics are uncertain at Medius scale.

**Mitigation:** Start with design partners. Test economics with 10-20 committed customers before major investment. Build partnerships with established payment networks rather than going fully proprietary.

#### 3. Organizational Readiness for Transformation

Executing this vision requires significant change—new capabilities, new go-to-market motions, new metrics. After 20 years as an AP automation company, can Medius's culture, talent, and processes transform fast enough? Organizational inertia is often the binding constraint.

**Mitigation:** Invest in change management. Hire transformation experience. Create isolated teams for new bets to protect from antibodies. Celebrate early wins aggressively.

#### 4. Marlin's Investment Horizon & Appetite

PE ownership creates both opportunity (capital for transformation) and constraint (timeline to exit). The strategic bets proposed here require 18-36 month investment horizons. Does the ownership structure support this? What's the exit thesis, and does this strategy serve it?

**Mitigation:** Align strategy to exit timeline. Sequence bets so early wins (e-invoicing, payment monetization) generate returns while platform bets (agentic AI) build strategic value. Frame investments in terms that resonate with financial sponsors.

---

## Conclusion

Medius has a rare opportunity: a strong market position, genuine AI capabilities, regulatory tailwinds, and the financial backing to invest for the future. The challenge is execution—moving decisively while the window is open.

The strategy I've outlined is designed to:

1. **Generate near-term wins** (e-invoicing compliance, payment monetization) that fund transformation and prove market fit
2. **Build durable differentiation** (agentic AI, data network effects) that compounds over time
3. **Create strategic optionality** (composable platform, partner ecosystem) that adapts to uncertainty
4. **Unite the organization** around a vision that's ambitious enough to attract talent and clear enough to execute

I'm excited about the possibility of helping Medius navigate this transformation. The combination of domain depth, AI opportunity, and market timing makes this a compelling challenge.
